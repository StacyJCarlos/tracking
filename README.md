#tracking (in development)
Command line time tracking with a minimal and configurable UI.

##Installation

```
gem install tracking
```

That's it!

If you want to know what's going on before you let Tracking's install scripts run, check out bootstrap.sh and the Rakefile.

##Features
- concise display, show one task on each line (with time started and time elapsed)
- simple syntax

##Ideas
- portable data
- configurable display
- hashtag-like tags for organizing tasks
- different ways to view your data

##Contributing to tracking
- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
